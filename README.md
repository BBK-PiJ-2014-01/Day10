Day10
=====
Exercise 1:
  - Classes OldPhone, MobilePhone, SmartPhone, PhoneLauncher implemented - code complete
  - recordNumbers() method added in Class MobilePhone

Exercise 2:
  - Call() method override in Class SmartPhone for International calls - code complete

Exercise 3:
  - All constructors modified to be able to call getBrand() method from the SmartPhone Class - code complete

Exercise 4:
  - 4.1: If playGame() is set to private, the sub-class SmartPhone cannot access the method.
  To make it work again, requires writing a playGame() method in the SmartPhone Class.
  As a comment, @Override does not apply when the original method is set to private
  - 4.2: RestrictedSmartPhone Class implemented
  Overriding the playGame() method and set it to private is not possible.
  The reason is that we can't downgrade the access set in the superclass..

Exercise 5:
